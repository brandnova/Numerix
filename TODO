**I'm ready to talk about adding more game modes!** ðŸŽ®

What kind of game modes are you thinking about? Some popular options for number guessing games could be:

2. **Endless Mode** - Continuously guessing with increasing difficulty
3. **Binary Search** - Educational mode teaching optimal search strategies
4. **Multiplayer** - Compete against friends or global leaderboards
5. **Story Mode** - Progressive challenges with narrative
6. **Practice Mode** - No stakes, just practice your skills

Which direction interests you most? I can help you design and implement any of these!
