**I'm ready to talk about adding more game modes!** ðŸŽ®

What kind of game modes are you thinking about? Some popular options for number guessing games could be:

1. **Practice Mode** - No stakes, just practice your skills
2. **Endless Mode** - Continuously guessing with increasing difficulty
3. **Puzzle Mode** - Solve mathematical puzzles to find the number âœ”
4. **Multiplayer** - Compete against friends locally or on global leaderboards
5. **Story Mode** - Progressive challenges with narrative
6. **Betting Mode** - Players can bet with in-app tokens to win more, or bet against each other on local multiplayer

Which direction interests you most? I can help you design and implement any of these!
